# 🤝 **Proof-of-Networking: Polygon BUIDL IT : Summer 2022**

Try out the demo, which [is hosted live here!](https://ceramic.network/)

## 🚀 **Statement**

### We are eager to continue the project after the hackathon in order to actually launch it in the world.

## 🔥 **Our Challenge for Hackathon**

- **Web3 Integration in Web2** - Build the Web3 version of your favorite Web2 product.
- **Nfts** - Combine creativity with Engineering to build awesome NFT dApps.
- **Designathon**

## 🎬 **Pitch & Live Demo (Video)**

## 💬 **Problem**

- **It’s hard for Web3 People to remember everyone they meet at events and re-connect later.**
    - As current Alternatives, some of them are documenting everything on Memo app or Spreadsheet.

- **Web2 Social Media is Broken**
    - Networks Sell your Data
        - You pay with your personal information to utilize their services. There is no digital Privacy.
    - User Data is Centralized
        - Data is controlled by one party largely behind closed doors, making it susceptible to attacks.
    - User Data is Not Portable
        - In Web2 implementation of platforms like Linkedin and Facebook User’s data is owned and gated by the app.


## 💡 **Solution**

- **Best UX for above usecases**
    - **You can combine all of your contact information into one profile.**
    - **You can also include other profile information in term of your identity and career.**
    - **Profile data is exchanged and stored with each other using QR codes.**
    - **Searchable Profile data.**
    - **The issuance of SBTs to prove that they have met will make the connection between users stronger and more memorable and composable.**

- **User can own social graph relationship’s data**

# 🤔 **Judges & Criteria**

## 1. Technological Implementation

### Tech Stack
- Front-End: NextJS, React, Typescript, Rainbowkit/Wagmi, Pixelated style 
- Contracts: Solidity 
- Back-End: Ceramic, Orbis, IPFS

### 📄 **Smart Contract Architecture**

Contracts were written with 


### Use of Polygon：Deployed to Polygon to issue SBTs to prove that users have met each other.

- test
    - test

### Use of IPFS：We used IPFS to store the user's Avatar data and metadata.

- test
    - test

### Use of AWS：Route53 was used to make the domain easy to understand.

- test
    - test

### We used Orbis on Ceramic for both fast and cheap UX and data portability.

- test
    - test

## 2. Design

### ①High Fidelity working prototype

- Try out the demo about the design and flow of the project at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/YJ8RSB0YWbRDTGxbsXVwdj/map?node-id=0%3A1).
    

### ②Presentation of Case Study

- こういった理由で、ここに課題があると特定し、〜が解決策になるという仮説をたてた。
    - test.
    test.

### ③User flow and thought process

- Try out the demo about the user flow and thought process at [Notion](https://www.notion.so/PoN-The-Proof-of-Networking-ebeda03aaeaf41088978ca13cb5dbd41) and [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPfrhW_M=/?share_link_id=58842346750) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/YJ8RSB0YWbRDTGxbsXVwdj/map?node-id=0%3A1).
   

### ④Branding and Design

**Part 2: UX Problem Statement for an audience with little to no web3 awareness**
- Be faster and cheaper than other Web3 products while maintaining elements of data ownership and decentralization.
    - We are able to optimize the data indexing experience.
    - It's a choice for users whether or not to issue an SBT.

### ⑤Problem-solving

- 課題は〜であり、解決策はなにである。だから、以下の解決策を提案している。
    - test.
   


## 3. Potential Impact

### ①Accelerating better encounters between people involved in Web3 can accelerate innovation in the ecosystem.
- We are building a world where people have a clearer, more transparent, best version of themselves, are more passionate about the status of the things they care about, and can find others who are working on the same issues. This is because by using our products, we can bring better encounters to the people involved in Web3. The moment when an idea evolves into a discontinuity is largely a result of encounters between people.

### ②Reinventing Web2Social puts the power back in the hands of the user.
- test.

### ③It will be a digital representation of an individual that does not rely on personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, gender, nationality, passport number, etc.
- test.

## 4. Quality of the Idea


**How Creative**
- We develop this idea based on real customer problems. We describe [here](https://www.notion.so/049750256bb34ba29f6a9feb70c93f75?v=d3a37aee9db345fe9569cb7e79cae048) the differences between us and other projects we have researched.


**How Unique**
- There are no products that specialize in business-card-like use cases, such as actually meeting people face to face and recording the meeting for Web3 people.
    - POAP is optimized for conference attendance verification, others are optimized for profile functions only, Gitcoin Passport is optimized for Gitcoin, Telegram and Twitter are optimized for Web2 messaging and social networking experiences.
- Very fast and inexpensive social experience compared to simlar did project.
    - This is because we are building without relying on the only blockchain using the Ceramic protocol while ensuring de-centralization. And. It's well optimized to query specific data in a very efficient way (we are optimizing it for the entire protocol)by using OrbisSDK compared to similar project by using only Ceramic itself.

- More Data potability
    - This design decision would keep interoperability with all products built on top of Ceramic, Orbis.sdk, orbis.club included, while extending the usecase for our digital business card product (it is kind of personal POAPS + decentralized business card), we call it Proof of Networking.

- Minting SBT instead of NFT is to prove that users have actually met compared to personal POAP.




# 📓 **Appendix**


## 5. Our Product Roadmap

### ①Adding more composable and sophisticated direct message functionality.

**How creatvie and unique**
- Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Messenger, Linkedin, What's app, Slack, LINE, WeChat, etc... Web2 has too many messaging tools that run on completely different protocols.There are some contexts for which data-portability will have more value than others, for example let's take DMs, the great benefit of composability is that you can bring your direct messages from one app to another and pick the user experience you like the most. For a platform dedicated 100% to video like youtube the data-portability would be useful to allow your followers to watch your content from any video app they want to (they aren't locked into one application)

### ②Launch on Mobile App like iOS and Android.

**How creatvie and unique**
- To make Web3Social's products a product market fit for consumers, it is necessary to achieve a better UX, and a mobile experience is essential to this. There are only a few projects in the industry that are able to combine data portability and mobile.

### ③The current trade-offs in terms of attack vectors, potential future integration of ZK proofs to enhance privacy.

**How creatvie and unique**
- test.
- 

### ④Adding Timeline feature for users.

**How creatvie and unique**
- test.
