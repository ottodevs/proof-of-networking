# Proof-of-Networking: Polygon BUIDL IT : Summer 2022

Try out the demo, which [is hosted live here!](https://ceramic.network/)

## 🚀**Statement**

### We are eager to continue the project after the hackathon in order to actually launch it in the world.

## Pitch & Live Demo (Video)


## 💬Problem

- **It’s hard for Web3 People to remember everyone they meet at events and re-connect later.**
    - As current Alternatives, some of them are documenting everything on Memo app or Spreadsheet.

- **Web2 Social Media is Broken**
    - Networks Sell your Data
        - You pay with your personal information to utilize their services. There is no digital Privacy.
    - User Data is Centralized
        - Data is controlled by one party largely behind closed doors, making it susceptible to attacks.
    - User Data is Not Portable
        - In Web2 implementation of platforms like Linkedin and Facebook User’s data is owned and gated by the app.


## Solution

- **Best UX for above usecases**
    - **You can combine all of your contact information into one profile.**
    - **You can also include other profile information in term of your identity and career.**
    - **Profile data is exchanged and stored with each other using QR codes.**
    - **Searchable Profile data.**
    - **The issuance of SBTs to prove that they have met will make the connection between users stronger and more memorable and composable.**

- **User can own social graph relationship’s data**

# Judges & Criteria

## 1. Technological Implementation

### Tech Stack
- Front-End: NextJS, React, Typescript, Rainbowkit/Wagmi, Pixelated style 
- Contracts: Solidity 
- Back-End: Ceramic, Orbis, IPFS
- Technologies: We are deployed on Polygon. We have ERC for test.


### 📄Smart Contract Architecture

Contracts were written with 


### Use of Polygon



### Use of IPFS


### Use of AWS


### Use of Ceramic and Orbis

### ④Branding and Design

**Part 2: UX Problem Statement for an audience with little to no web3 awareness**
- Be faster and cheaper than other Web3 products while maintaining elements of data ownership and decentralization.
    - We are able to optimize the data indexing experience.
    - It's a choice for users whether or not to issue an SBT.

### ⑤Problem-solving

## 3. Potential Impact

### ①Accelerating better encounters between people involved in Web3 can accelerate innovation in the ecosystem.
- We are building a world where people have a clearer, more transparent, best version of themselves, are more passionate about the status of the things they care about, and can find others who are working on the same issues. This is because by using our products, we can bring better encounters to the people involved in Web3. The moment when an idea evolves into a discontinuity is largely a result of encounters between people.

### ②Reinventing Web2Social puts the power back in the hands of the user.
- test.

### ③It will be a digital representation of an individual that does not rely on personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, gender, nationality, passport number, etc.
- test.

## 4. Quality of the Idea


**How Creative**
- We develop this idea based on real customer problems.


**How Unique**
- There are no products that specialize in business-card-like use cases, such as actually meeting people face to face and recording the meeting for Web3 people.
    - POAP is optimized for conference attendance verification, others are optimized for profile functions only, Gitcoin Passport is optimized for Gitcoin, Telegram and Twitter are optimized for Web2 messaging and social networking experiences.
- Very fast and inexpensive social experience compared to simlar did project.
    - This is because we are building without relying on the only blockchain using the Ceramic protocol while ensuring de-centralization. And. It's well optimized to query specific data in a very efficient way (we are optimizing it for the entire protocol)by using OrbisSDK compared to similar project by using only Ceramic itself.

- More Data potability
    - This design decision would keep interoperability with all products built on top of Ceramic, Orbis.sdk, orbis.club included, while extending the usecase for our digital business card product (it is kind of personal POAPS + decentralized business card), we call it Proof of Networking.

- Minting SBT instead of NFT is to prove that users have actually met compared to personal POAP.
